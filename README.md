# Project-Titanic
Project under the AI+ML training+internship from E&amp;ICT Academy, IIT Kanpur

The project is based on a dataset named ‘Titanic’ containing the details of 1309 (possibly fictitious) passengers onboard the infamous ship (Passenger ID, Ticket ID, Cabin status, Name, Age, Embarkment port, Sex, number of siblings/spouse(s) aboard, number of parents/children aboard, Passenger-class, Fare and whether the passenger survived the tragedy or not).

A machine learning model has been built to analyse the given dataset and make predictions according to whatever pattern it identifies within the data.

The task at hand is to train the machine learning model such that based on all or some of the details given in the dataset, it is able to predict the outcome of a passenger in terms of survival with as much accuracy as possible.

The dataset was processed and certain details or records had to be manipulated or filtered out in order to make the raw data fit to be understood and worked on by the model.
Various ML classification models had been deployed in the process, two of which (Linear Regression and Decision Tree Classifier with accuracy percentages of 81.56% and 84.35% respectively) were retained after filtering.
